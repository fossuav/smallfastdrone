## Open Issues

1. **Ground effect + frozen correction conflict** — [logjk4](logs/logjk4.md) shows
   frozen correction creates phantom acceleration during ground effect; fix proposed
   but not yet implemented
2. **Post-landing EKF divergence** — ground effect protection accumulates error that
   causes drift after disarm
3. **Ground effect flags clear too early** — uses EKF altitude (which can be wrong)
   instead of rangefinder
4. **Aggressive takeoff on SFDv1** — MOT_THST_HOVER=0.095 but actual hover 0.072 and ThH
   still reads 0.125 internally. Fix: MOT_THST_HOVER=0.07, TKOFF_SLEW_TIME=1.0-1.5.
5. **TD vehicle parameter drift** — [log3](logs/log3.md)/[log4](logs/log4.md) show
   INS_ACC_VRFB_Z=-0.343 (corrupted, should be small positive), ACC_ZBIAS_LEARN=0
   (disabled), TKOFF_GNDEFF_TMO=0, MAG_CAL=3/MOTCT=0. Persistent IVD=-0.54 m/s in log4
   and 0.69m core divergence are direct consequences. Fix: zero VRFB, enable ZBIAS_LEARN=2,
   set GNDEFF_TMO=3, MAG_CAL=7, MOTCT=2.

## Resolved Issues

1. **VRFB clamp raised to ±0.6** — [logtd8](logs/logtd8.md) showed true vibration
   rectification of ~0.57 m/s² exceeded the original ±0.3 clamp. MAX_HOVER_BIAS_CORRECTION
   raised to 0.6f in both InitialiseFilter and setHoverZBiasCorrection.
2. **Zero velocity fusion CI failures** — Fusing at IMU rate (400Hz) overconstrained the filter;
   fusing before tiltAlignComplete caused "EKF attitude is bad". Fixed by gating behind
   `fuseHgtData` and `tiltAlignComplete`. See [EKF3 CLAUDE.md](../libraries/AP_NavEKF3/CLAUDE.md).
3. **Ground effect default threshold** — TKOFF_GNDEFF_ALT=0 changed default from 0.50m to 0m;
   fixed with `is_positive()` fallback to original 0.50m.
4. **TCAL upside-down calibration** — [log201](logs/log201.md) confirmed recalibration right-side
   up fixed the 3.8x Z-axis overcorrection. ACC1_Z went from 55844 to -3597.
5. **Yaw inconsistency from motor interference** — [log201](logs/log201.md) traced 24° divergence
   to COMPASS_MOTCT=0 + MAG_CAL=4. Fixed with COMPASS_MOTCT=2 + new EK3_MAG_CAL=7
   ([verified in log208](topics/mag_cal_7_verification.md): divergence reduced to 5.3°).
6. **Roll oscillation on SFDv1** — [log208](logs/log208.md) 8-10 Hz limit cycle from coupled
   angle-rate resonance with high autotune gains on asymmetric airframe. Fixed by reducing
   ANG_RLL_P: 27→20, ANG_PIT_P: 31→27, RAT_RLL_P: 0.056→0.048. [Verified in log209](logs/log209.md):
   overshoot ratio 1.52→0.82, dominant frequency 8 Hz→3 Hz.
